# Project Description
In this project, I use a neural network to clone car driving behavior. It is a supervised regression problem between the car steering angles and the road images in front of a car.

Those images were taken from three different camera angles (from the center, the left and the right of the car).

The network is based on The NVIDIA model, which has been proven to work in this problem domain.

As image processing is involved, the model is using convolutional layers for automated feature engineering.

# Model Architecture Design
The design of the network is based on the NVIDIA model, which has been used by NVIDIA for the end-to-end self driving test. As such, it is well suited for the project.

It is a deep convolution network which works well with supervised image classification / regression problems. As the NVIDIA model is well documented, I was able to focus how to adjust the training images to produce the best result with some adjustments to the model to avoid overfitting and adding non-linearity to improve the prediction.

I've added the following adjustments to the model.

I used Lambda layer to normalized input images to avoid saturation and make gradients work better.
I've added an additional dropout layer to avoid overfitting after the convolution layers.
I've also included ELU for activation function for every layer except for the output layer to introduce non-linearity.
In the end, the model looks like as follows:

Image normalization
Convolution: 5x5, filter: 24, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
Convolution: 5x5, filter: 36, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
Convolution: 5x5, filter: 48, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
Convolution: 3x3, filter: 64, strides: 1x1, activation: ELU
Convolution: 3x3, filter: 64, strides: 1x1, activation: ELU
Drop out (0.5)
Fully connected: neurons: 100, activation: ELU
Fully connected: neurons: 50, activation: ELU
Fully connected: neurons: 10, activation: ELU
Fully connected: neurons: 1 (output)
As per the NVIDIA model, the convolution layers are meant to handle feature engineering and the fully connected layer for predicting the steering angle. However, as stated in the NVIDIA document, it is not clear where to draw such a clear distinction. Overall, the model is very functional to clone the given steering behavior.

# Data Preprocessing
## Image Sizing
the images are cropped so that the model wonâ€™t be trained with the sky and the car front parts
the images are resized to 66x200 (3 YUV channels) as per NVIDIA model
the images are normalized (image data divided by 127.5 and subtracted 1.0). As stated in the Model Architecture section, this is to avoid saturation and make gradients work better)

# Model Training
## Image Augumentation
For training, I used the following augumentation technique along with Python generator to generate unlimited number of images:

Randomly choose right, left or center images.
For left image, steering angle is adjusted by +0.2
For right image, steering angle is adjusted by -0.2
Randomly flip image left/right
Randomly translate image horizontally with steering angle adjustment (0.002 per pixel shift)
Randomly translate image vertically
Randomly altering image brightness (lighter or darker)
Using the left/right images is useful to train the recovery driving scenario. The horizontal translation is useful for difficult curve handling (i.e. the one after the bridge).

# Training, Validation and Test
I splitted the images into train and validation set in order to measure the performance at every epoch. Testing was done using the simulator.

As for training,

I used mean squared error for the loss function to measure how close the model predicts to the given steering angle for each image.
I used Adam optimizer for optimization with learning rate of 1.0e-4 which is smaller than the default of 1.0e-3. The default value was too big and made the validation loss stop improving too soon.
I used ModelCheckpoint from Keras to save the model only if the validation loss is improved which is checked for every epoch.
